# Speech-to-Speech Recognition

This project is a speech-to-speech recognition system that aims to convert spoken language into text and then synthesize it back into speech in another language. The system leverages deep learning models for speech recognition and translation, providing a seamless experience for real-time communication across different languages.

## Features

- **Speech Recognition**: Converts spoken language into text using advanced speech recognition models.
- **Translation**: Translates the recognized text into a target language.
- **Speech Synthesis**: Converts the translated text back into speech using text-to-speech technology.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Enables real-time communication by processing speech inputs and outputs with minimal delay.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/turgutkaya34/speech-to-speech-recognition.git
   cd speech-to-speech-recognition
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the speech-to-speech recognition system, follow these steps:

1. **Configure the Input and Output Languages:**

   Edit the configuration file to set the desired input and output languages. For example, to translate from English to Spanish:

   ```python
   INPUT_LANGUAGE = 'en'
   OUTPUT_LANGUAGE = 'es'
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**

   You can start the application with the following command:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

3. **Provide Speech Input:**

   Once the application is running, you can speak into the microphone. The system will recognize your speech, translate it, and output the translated speech in real-time.

## Example

Here is an example of how the system works:

1. **Input Speech:** "Hello, how are you?"
2. **Recognized Text:** "Hello, how are you?"
3. **Translated Text:** "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"
4. **Output Speech:** "Hola, ¿cómo estás?"

## Dependencies

The project requires the following main libraries:

- **SpeechRecognition**: For capturing and recognizing speech.
- **Googletrans**: For translating recognized text between languages.
- **gTTS**: For converting text to speech.

Ensure all dependencies are installed by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
