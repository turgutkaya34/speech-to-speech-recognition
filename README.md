Speech-to-speech-recognition

Overview
This project is a Python-based application designed to enable interactive voice-based communication using AI. The application integrates with OpenAI and Eleven Labs APIs for generating responses and converting text to speech, creating a seamless and dynamic user experience. It features real-time voice processing, customizable interfaces, and easy integration with external services.

Features
Voice Processing: Capture and process audio inputs using pyaudio and rhasspy-silence for effective voice interaction.
OpenAI Integration: Interacts with OpenAI's API to generate context-aware responses.
Eleven Labs Integration: Utilizes Eleven Labs API for high-quality text-to-speech conversion.
Interactive Display: Custom CSS (display.css) ensures a responsive and user-friendly interface.
